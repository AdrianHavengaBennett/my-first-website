# My Very First Web Page

Welcome!

It's been an up and down ride learning this stuff but this project is something I'm proud of.

Beginning at HTML5, dancing through the raindow forest of CSS3, and then reaching the jungle of Git/Github, this project shows potential. This is but the beginning.

I found inspiration on my colour (yes, I'm British!) choices here: https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/ 

And here's a good read on background-position: https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-position/

I can't tell you yet what else is coming because I haven't learned it. But what I can say is watch this space, because with the Code Institute guiding my path, together we can touch the sky.

Stick around, friends.
Adrian
